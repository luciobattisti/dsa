The selection sort algorithm is a straightforward sorting technique. Here's a description of how it works:

1. **Divide the List**: Imagine the list you're sorting is divided into two parts: a *sorted* section and an *unsorted* section. At the beginning, the sorted section is empty, and the unsorted section contains the entire list.

2. **Find the Smallest Element**: In each step, you look for the smallest element in the unsorted section of the list.

3. **Swap**: Once you find the smallest element, swap it with the first element in the unsorted section. Now, that element is in the correct position, so it becomes part of the sorted section.

4. **Repeat**: Move to the next element in the unsorted section and repeat the process. Continue finding the smallest element from the remaining unsorted elements and swapping it into the correct position. This process gradually grows the sorted section and shrinks the unsorted section.

5. **Continue Until Sorted**: Repeat this until all elements are in the sorted section. At this point, the entire list is sorted.

### Key Points
- **Time Complexity**: Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), making it inefficient for large datasets.
- **Space Complexity**: It is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it requires a constant amount of additional memory ((O(1)).
- **Performance**: Unlike bubble sort, selection sort makes fewer swaps, which can be beneficial if writing to memory is costly. However, it still performs poorly on large lists compared to more efficient algorithms like mergesort or quicksort. 

Selection sort is simple and easy to implement but is generally not used in practice for sorting large arrays. It serves as a good educational tool for understanding sorting concepts.
