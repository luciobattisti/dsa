### **Challenge: Design a Library Management System**  
You need to design a **Library Management System** following the **SOLID** principles. The system should support:  
1. **Adding books** to the library.  
2. **Borrowing and returning books**.  
3. **Tracking borrowed books**.  
4. **Notifying users when a book is due soon**.  

#### **Requirements:**  
- Use **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Separate concerns properly.  
- Apply **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Allow adding new features without modifying existing code.  
- Use **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Ensure subclass compatibility.  
- Apply **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Avoid forcing classes to implement unnecessary methods.  
- Use **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Depend on abstractions rather than concrete classes.  

#### **Bonus:**  
- Use **Dependency Injection**.  
- Implement **a notification system** (email/SMS).
